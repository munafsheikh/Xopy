# Xopy 


This app is a JavaFX copy-format-paste utility.

The objective is to copy some text, detect any json, xml or yml (or any other popular formats), reformat the text when pasting it.

It should work seamlessly
* with the Windows clipboard. It can at a later stage be extended for linux.
* using shortcuts
* with security in mind
* work offline. 


This app, and all versions of it need to remain opensource.
